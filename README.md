# SQL Project: Data Analysis for Zomato - A Food Delivery Company

## Overview

This project demonstrates my SQL problem-solving skills through the analysis of data for Zomato, a popular food delivery company in India. The project involves setting up the database, importing data, handling null values, and solving a variety of business problems using complex SQL queries.

## Project Structure

- **Database Setup:** Creation of the `zomato_db` database and the required tables.
- **Data Import:** Inserting sample data into the tables.
- **Data Cleaning:** Handling null values and ensuring data integrity.
- **Business Problems:** Solving 20 specific business problems using SQL queries.


## Database Setup
```sql
CREATE DATABASE zomato_db;
```

### 1. Dropping Existing Tables
```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS deliveries;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS Orders;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS customers;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS restaurants;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS riders;

-- 2. Creating Tables
CREATE TABLE restaurants (
    restaurant_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    restaurant_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    city VARCHAR(50),
    opening_hours VARCHAR(50)
);

CREATE TABLE customers (
    customer_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    reg_date DATE
);

CREATE TABLE riders (
    rider_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    rider_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    sign_up DATE
);

CREATE TABLE Orders (
    order_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_id INT,
    restaurant_id INT,
    order_item VARCHAR(255),
    order_date DATE NOT NULL,
    order_time TIME NOT NULL,
    order_status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'Pending',
    total_amount DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES customers(customer_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (restaurant_id) REFERENCES restaurants(restaurant_id)
);

CREATE TABLE deliveries (
    delivery_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    order_id INT,
    delivery_status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'Pending',
    delivery_time TIME,
    rider_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (order_id) REFERENCES Orders(order_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (rider_id) REFERENCES riders(rider_id)
);
```

## Data Import

## Data Cleaning and Handling Null Values

Before performing analysis, I ensured that the data was clean and free from null values where necessary. For instance:

```sql
UPDATE orders
SET total_amount = COALESCE(total_amount, 0);
```

## Business Problems Solved

### 1. Write a query to find the top 5 most frequently ordered dishes by customer called "Arjun Mehta" in the last 1 year.

```sql
WITH CTE AS(
SELECT 
    c.customer_id, 
    c.customer_name, 
    o.order_item, 
    COUNT(*) AS total_orders,
    DENSE_RANK() OVER(ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC)rnk
FROM 
    customers c 
JOIN 
    orders o 
ON 
    c.customer_id = o.customer_id
WHERE 
    o.order_date >= DATE_SUB('2024-09-02', INTERVAL 1 YEAR) -- DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE(), INTERVAL 1 YEAR) AS LastYearDate;
    AND c.customer_name = 'Arjun Mehta'
GROUP BY 
    c.customer_id, c.customer_name, o.order_item)
	SELECT customer_id, customer_name, order_item, total_orders 
	FROM CTE
		WHERE rnk <=5;
```

### 2. Popular Time Slots
-- Question: Identify the time slots during which the most orders are placed. based on 2-hour intervals.

**Approach 1:**

```sql
-- Approach 1
SELECT  
	FLOOR(HOUR(order_time)/2)*2 AS start_time,
	FLOOR(HOUR(order_time)/2)*2 +2 AS end_time,
	COUNT(*) AS total_order
FROM orders 
	GROUP BY start_time, end_time
	ORDER BY total_order DESC;
```

**Approach 2:**

```sql
SELECT
    CASE
        WHEN EXTRACT(HOUR FROM order_time) BETWEEN 0 AND 1 THEN '00:00 - 02:00'
        WHEN EXTRACT(HOUR FROM order_time) BETWEEN 2 AND 3 THEN '02:00 - 04:00'
        WHEN EXTRACT(HOUR FROM order_time) BETWEEN 4 AND 5 THEN '04:00 - 06:00'
        WHEN EXTRACT(HOUR FROM order_time) BETWEEN 6 AND 7 THEN '06:00 - 08:00'
        WHEN EXTRACT(HOUR FROM order_time) BETWEEN 8 AND 9 THEN '08:00 - 10:00'
        WHEN EXTRACT(HOUR FROM order_time) BETWEEN 10 AND 11 THEN '10:00 - 12:00'
        WHEN EXTRACT(HOUR FROM order_time) BETWEEN 12 AND 13 THEN '12:00 - 14:00'
        WHEN EXTRACT(HOUR FROM order_time) BETWEEN 14 AND 15 THEN '14:00 - 16:00'
        WHEN EXTRACT(HOUR FROM order_time) BETWEEN 16 AND 17 THEN '16:00 - 18:00'
        WHEN EXTRACT(HOUR FROM order_time) BETWEEN 18 AND 19 THEN '18:00 - 20:00'
        WHEN EXTRACT(HOUR FROM order_time) BETWEEN 20 AND 21 THEN '20:00 - 22:00'
        WHEN EXTRACT(HOUR FROM order_time) BETWEEN 22 AND 23 THEN '22:00 - 00:00'
    END AS time_slot,
    COUNT(order_id) AS order_count
FROM Orders
GROUP BY time_slot
ORDER BY order_count DESC;
```

### 3. Order Value Analysis
-- Question: Find the average order value per customer who has placed more than 750 orders.
-- Return customer_name, and aov(average order value)

```sql
SELECT 
    c.customer_name, ROUND(AVG(o.total_amount),2)AS average_order_value
FROM
    customers c
        JOIN
    orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
GROUP BY c.customer_name
HAVING COUNT(o.order_id) > 750;
```

### 4. High-Value Customers
-- Question: List the customers who have spent more than 100K in total on food orders.
-- return customer_name, and customer_id!

```sql
SELECT 
    c.customer_name, SUM(o.total_amount)AS total_order_value
FROM
    customers c
        JOIN
    orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
GROUP BY c.customer_name
HAVING SUM(o.total_amount) >= 100000
ORDER BY total_order_value DESC;
```

### 5. Orders Without Delivery
-- Question: Write a query to find orders that were placed but not delivered. 
-- Return each restuarant name, city and number of not delivered orders 

```sql
-- Approach 1
SELECT 
    r.restaurant_name,
    r.city,
    COUNT(o.order_id) not_delivered_order
FROM
    orders o
        LEFT JOIN
    restaurants r ON r.restaurant_id = o.restaurant_id
        LEFT JOIN
    deliveries d ON d.order_id = o.order_id
WHERE
    d.delivery_id IS NULL
GROUP BY r.restaurant_name , r.city
ORDER BY not_delivered_order DESC;

-- Approach 2
SELECT 
	r.restaurant_name,
	COUNT(*)
FROM orders as o

```

### 12. Customer Segmentation:
